3)Conclusion


1)Detailed information 
2)Working sample project 
(This is the ideal case)

////////When "Question / Problem not directly related to company’s products"

Example 1:
Sending information from the client to the server via JavaScript is  not directly related to RadControls,
 but is a general programming task. There are several ways to do that and which one you would choose depends 
 entirely on you and on the exact setup that you have – more information on this matter is available in
 various  resources on the Internet. For example, if you are working with postbacks, you could use __doPostback()
 (link to an article which  covers this subject in details). If you are using RadAjax, you could use 
 RadAjaxManager’s ajaxRequest() / ajaxRequestWithTarget()  methods (links to the online documentation 
 of RadAjaxManager’s client-side API) to do that. 
 
 Example 2:
 This problem is not directly related to RadXXX but to the way the browser works – you will experience the 
 same behavior if you are using YYYYY (standard controls). For your convenience I attached a small sample 
 to this thread that reproduces the same problem – as you can see, there are no RadControls in it, only 
 standard HTML / ASP.NET controls.

 ///////////When "Ask for additional details!"

 Hello Ben, 
I tried to reproduce the problem locally but to no avail – everything is working as expected on our side. 
Please provide the following details – hopefully they will help us pinpoint the exact reason for this behavior:
	1)What is the exact browser’s version that you are using? 
	2)In the ticket info, you have noted that you are using version XXXX of RadXXX. Could you please confirm that? 
	3)Please send us the exact steps to reproduce the problem. If possible, send us some screenshots of the 
	observed behavior. 
For convenience I prepared a small sample, based on the information that you provided so far and attached it to
this thread. Could you please check it and let me know how it differs from your real setup? 
Thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation. 


//////ANGRY

Please let me help you. explain to me the problem in detail.

I can understand your frustration with


//////Bullets

The solution for this scenario is the following:
O-Add a MS SplitContainer control in your inner form
O-In the left split panel add a docking manager
O-Add a DockPanel

/////HIGHLIGHT

Show empathy. :

“I can see your point on the matter” 
“I can understand how this issue is frustrating you.”  
“I am sorry to see your disappointment.”


Write something positive :

“As we can see your point on the matter, we’ve decided to…”
“Let me see how we can get this fixed.” 


Show the customer that their problem is your main concern. :


“How long have you had this problem?” 
“Thank you for your detailed report. The information helped us find the cause for the issue. 
Basically our controls…, this is why a better approach is to…”
“Unfortunately we will have to further investigate the case to find the cause and fix it.
 However, in the meantime we’ve come up with the following workaround.

Positive language pattern:

"Congratulations on your new business.  To register your business name, we need some additional information.
  If you return the attached form, with highlighted areas filled in, we will be able to send you your business
  registration certificate within two weeks.  We wish you success in your new endeavor." 


“That is a good question. Let me find out for you.”

 //////CHANGE TO
 
“We cannot do that.” : to
“What you can do is take a look at those sample projects and use them to start building your logic following 
these tutorials.”

“You will have to…”  : to
“One option would be for you to…” 
“I want to get started on this right away and it would be great if you could send …” 
 “I would suggest trying …”

 “We can’t fix this now.” to -> “We will do our best to fix it as soon as possible.”
 “The control doesn’t support this functionality.” to ->
 ”We will create a feature request based on your feedback and if it gathers enough popularity, 
 we will definitely consider its implementation.”
