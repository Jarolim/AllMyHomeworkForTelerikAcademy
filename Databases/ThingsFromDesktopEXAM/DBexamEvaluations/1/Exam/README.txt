Hello Anonymous user! :)

Here are some guides to this project:
1. The SQLHelper file contains a few SQLQueries to help you clear the DB and select everything from the DB.
2. Please edit the connections strings in all the App.config files or the project may not work for you.
NOTE: The project was written on SQL Server Pro for Devs SP1 
3. Don't forget to import the BookstoreSystemDB.sql for the DB Shema.

And that's it :)
