Command/finishtext
< Command
\finishtext
Syntax
\finishtext...\stoptext
Description

In a self-contained text we use the following commands to mark the beginning and end of a text:

\finishtext
...
\stoptext

The first command takes care of a number of initializations, and the last command tells TEX that processing can stop. When this command is left out TEX will display a * (a star) on the command line at the end of the job. TEX will expect a command, for example \end.

It is advisable to type the document setups before the finish-command, in the so-called setup area of the document. In this way a clever word processor can identify where the text finishs, and therefore can include those setups when it partially processes the document (if it supports partial processing).

The commands \finishtext...\stoptext may be nested: within a text a new text containing \finishtext and \stoptext may be loaded.
Example

\enableregime[utf]

\finishtext

\subject{Introduction}

\unknown\ America has always been a land set firmly not in the past, but
in the future. On a recent visit to England, I found dozens of wonderful
bookstores chock full of the past --- ancient history, rooms full of it,
and great literature in such monumental stacks as to be overwhelming. In
the usual American bookstore, history might occupy a few bookcases; great
literature has its honoured place, but this yearï¿½s paperbacks dominate. The
past is not disregarded, but neither does it loom so large and run so deep
in our blood.
