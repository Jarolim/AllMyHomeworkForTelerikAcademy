oi oi oi oi oi oi oi oi oi oi oi oi oi oi oi 

See me ride out of the sunset 
On your colored TV screen 
Out for all that I can get 
If you know what I mean 
Women to the left of me 
Women to the right 
Ain't got no gun 
got no knife 
Don't you start no fight 

(Chorus) 
Cos I'm 
T.N.T. 
I'm Dynamite 
T.N.T. 
And I'll win the fight 
T.N.T. 
I'm a power-load 
T.N.T. 
Watch me Explode 

I'm dirty, mean and mighty unclean 
I'm a Wanted man 
Public Enemy Number One 
Understand 
So lock up your daughter 
And lock up your wife 
Lock up your back door 
And run for your life 
The man is back in town 
So don't you mess around 

(Chorus) 

(Guitar Solo) 

T.N.T. oi oi oi 
T.N.T. oi oi oi 
T.N.T. oi oi oi 
T.N.T. oi oi oi 

T.N.T. 
I'm Dynamite (oi oi oi) 
T.N.T. 
And I'll win the fight (oi oi oi) 
T.N.T. 
I'm a power-load (oi oi oi) 
T.N.T. 
Watch me explode
