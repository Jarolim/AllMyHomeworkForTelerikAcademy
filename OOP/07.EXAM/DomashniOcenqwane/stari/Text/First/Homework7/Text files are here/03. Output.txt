1 Can't run from you
2 I just run back to you.
3 Like a moth I'm drawn in to your flame,
4 Say my name, but it's not the same.
5 You look in my eyes I'm stripped of my pride.
6 And my soul surrenders and you bring my heart to its knees.
7 
8 [Chorus:]
9 And it's killin' me when you're away, I wanna leave and I wanna stay.
10 I'm so confused,So hard to choose.
11 Between the pleasure and the pain.
12 And I know it's wrong, and I know it's right.
13 Even if I try to win the fight, my heart would overrule my mind.
14 And I'm not strong enough to stay away
15 
16 I'm not strong enough to stay away
17 What can I do
18 I would die without you
19 In your presence my heart knows no shame
20 I'm not to blame
21 Cause you bring my heart to its knees
22 
23 [Chorus]
24 
25 There's nothing I can do
26 My heart is chained to you
27 And I can't get free
28 Look what this love's done to me
29 
30 [Chorus]
31
