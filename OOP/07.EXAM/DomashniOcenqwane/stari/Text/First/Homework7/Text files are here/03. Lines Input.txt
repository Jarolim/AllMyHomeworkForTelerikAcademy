I'm not strong enough to stay away.
Can't run from you
I just run back to you.
Like a moth I'm drawn in to your flame,
Say my name, but it's not the same.
You look in my eyes I'm stripped of my pride.
And my soul surrenders and you bring my heart to its knees.

[Chorus:]
And it's killin' me when you're away, I wanna leave and I wanna stay.
I'm so confused,So hard to choose.
Between the pleasure and the pain.
And I know it's wrong, and I know it's right.
Even if I try to win the fight, my heart would overrule my mind.
And I'm not strong enough to stay away

I'm not strong enough to stay away
What can I do
I would die without you
In your presence my heart knows no shame
I'm not to blame
Cause you bring my heart to its knees

[Chorus]

There's nothing I can do
My heart is chained to you
And I can't get free
Look what this love's done to me

[Chorus]
